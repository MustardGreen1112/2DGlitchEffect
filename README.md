2D Glitch Effect in Unity
This is a UI shader in a technology style. 
It consists of the glitch effect, stripes interference effect, and chromatic aberration effect. There is a sample scene in the Unity project and a sample mp4 in the folder. 
In the StageSelector script, there is a simple demonstration on how to use the shader. It is easy to set the _GlobalController attribute to control the image effect.
