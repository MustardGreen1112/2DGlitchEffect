# 2D Glitch Effect in Unity

This is a UI shader in a technology style.

It consists of the glitch effect, stripes interference effect, and chromatic aberration effect. There is a sample scene in the Unity project and a sample mp4 in the folder. 

## How to Use

In the StageSelector script, there is a simple demonstration of how to use the shader. It is easy to set the _GlobalController attribute to control the image effect. And for static/lasting effect, you could delete some of the code about _GlobalController and add what you want on controlling.
